* About
** 
*** Intro
    My name is Matthew Sessions and I am a student of Computer Science at Oregon State. I have
    been an undergrad TA for many courses and currently work as an undergrad research assistant.

*** Undergraduate Research Assistant for PDL at OSU
    Most of my work at [[https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/protodevlab/prototype-development-laboratory][PDL]] involves writing firmware for embedded systems as well as the 
    applications that clients use to interface with these systems.

* Technical
** 
*** Languages
    Here's a list of languages that I've used in projects.
    '('C 'C++ 'Javascript 'Clojurescript 'HTML 'CSS 'CL 'Python 'Bash 'Kotlin)
    
    Developing applications with Common Lisp is neat.

*** Frameworks
    The two frameworks that I've used the most are React and the Nordic BLE SDK.

    For personal projects I use GTK3.

* Read
** 
*** The Little Schemer
This book really helped with understanding the core fundamentals of writing lisp programs and how
to write concise code in any language.

* Hobby
** 
*** Systems
    I am using Gentoo hardeneded that I build and binhost from my server. These are the programs that I use most.
    - Openbox
    - tint2
    - dmenu
    - xss-lock
    - st
    - Emacs

*** 3D Printing
    Creating models with OpenSCAD works alright. I don't make anything all that sophisticated,
    but it is much more convenient than popsicle sticks, paperclips, and hot glue. 

*** Anime
    Has interesting enough stories, generally.

*** Lisp
    If something can be ported (in a reasonable amount of time) to Emacs or CL it becomes my new
    project.
