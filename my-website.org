* About
[[https://sessions-matthew.github.io/][HTML Version]]

** 
*** Intro
    My name is Matthew Sessions and I am a student of Computer Science
    at Oregon State. I have been an undergrad TA for many courses and
    currently work as an undergrad research assistant. My expected
    graduation date is this *Fall of 2021* with an undergraduate's
    degree in Computer Science of the Systems option.

*** Undergraduate Research Assistant for PDL at OSU
    As a research assistant with [[https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/protodevlab/prototype-development-laboratory][PDL]] I have lead, designed and
		implemented various projects for clients that involved writing
		firmware for a range of embedded systems in C/C++ to interface
		with applications over communication protocols such as BLE or LTE.

* Technical
** 
*** Languages
    Here's a list of languages that I've used in projects.
		#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
		'('C 'C++ 'Javascript 'Clojurescript
		 'HTML 'CSS 'CL 'Python 'Bash 'Kotlin)
		#+END_SRC
    
*** Frameworks
		Between projects I have used various frameworks, my most used are
		as follows:
		- ReactJS / React Native
		- Nordic nRF5 SDK
		- Zephyr OS
		- Arduino

* Read
** 
*** The Little Schemer
		This book really helped with understanding the core fundamentals
		of writing lisp programs and how to write concise and functional
		code in any language.

*** OSTEP
		This book helped me better understand the fundamentals of what
		makes a good operating system and when it is appropriate to
		use operating system in a project.

* Hobby
** 
*** Systems
    I use Gentoo hardened, these are the programs that I use
    most:
    - Openbox
    - tint2
    - dmenu
    - xss-lock
    - st
    - Emacs

*** 3D Printing
		As a hobby and to avoid using popsicle sticks and paperclips I
		have made models with OpenSCAD that I have then printed from my 3d
		printer.
