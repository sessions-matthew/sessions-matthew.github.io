* About
** 
*** Intro
				My name is Matthew Sessions and I am a student of Computer Science at Oregon State. I have
				been an undergrad TA for many courses but I don't think that academia is the place for me.

*** Undergraduate Research Assistant for PDL at OSU
				Most of my work at [[https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/protodevlab/prototype-development-laboratory][PDL]] involves writing firmware for embedded systems as well as the 
				applications that clients use to interface with these systems.

* Technical
** 
*** Languages
				Being able to run uLisp on AVR is neat, but it uses most of what little memory is available.
				- C/C++
				- Javascript, Clojurescript, HTML, CSS
				- uLisp / SBCL Common Lisp
				- Python, Bash
				- Kotlin
				SBCL with SLY/SLIME is most convenient for rapidly developing applications, even ones with GUIs.

*** Frameworks
				I still would like to try Clojurescript + React Native at some point.
				- ExpressJS
				- React JS/Native
				- Flutter
				- Nordic BLE SDK
				The Nordic SDK takes some getting used to, but it really does a lot for you if you can
				figure out how to use it properly.

* Read
** 
*** The Little Schemer
This book really helped with understanding the core fundamentals of writing lisp programs and how
to write concise code in any language.

* Hobby
** 
*** Set Up
				I am using Gentoo hardeneded that I build and binhost from my server. These are the programs that I use most.
    - Openbox
    - tint2
    - dmenu
				- xss-lock
    - st
    - Emacs
				Emacs handles my notes, RSS feeds, code writing, etc. This page is a styled org file
				that I edit in Emacs and then export to HTML.

*** 3D Printing
				Creating models with OpenSCAD works alright. I don't make anything all that sophisticated,
				but it is much more convenient than popsicle sticks, paperclips, and hot glue. 

*** Anime
				Have watched a lot of anime and plan to watch more.
